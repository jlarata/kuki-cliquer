# kuki-cliquer is an ASCII-Idle inspired game conceived to improve and practice my javaScript and HTML/CSS knowledge and skills.
# It's named by homophony/slang in latinoamerican spanish as an obvious reference to Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) a game created by some
# european dude named orteil (https://orteil.dashnet.org/)
# It's also named after mi cousin Kuki, who probably doesn't remember, but brought me into some great discoveries like _Dune_ (the 1992 gane by Cryo Interactive),
# and _audiogalaxy_ (the p2p mp3 sharing application in earlies 2000s).
