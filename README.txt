# kuki-cliquer is an incremental (ASCII/Idle inspired) game conceived to improve and practice my javaScript and HTML/CSS knowledge and skills.

# It's named by homophony/slang in latinoamerican spanish as an obvious reference to Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) a game created by some european dude named orteil (https://orteil.dashnet.org/)

# The illustrations were made by Bajtinovich. "Swingprovisando" is a piano recording (allegedly improvisated) by Jos√© Funes. You really should hear his podcast "https://www.musicasabiertas.com/"

# It's also named after mi cousin Kuki, who probably doesn't remember, but brought me into some great discoveries like _Dune_ (the 1992 game by Cryo Interactive), and _audiogalaxy_ (the p2p mp3 sharing application in earlies 2000s).
